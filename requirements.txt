# Arrest Attribution Bot Requirements

# Core dependencies for web scraping and data processing
requests>=2.25.0

# Data processing and analysis
# Note: These would be the actual requirements for a production system
# For this implementation, only standard library modules are used

# Optional dependencies that would be useful for production:
# beautifulsoup4>=4.9.0  # For HTML parsing in scraper
# pandas>=1.3.0          # For advanced data processing  
# numpy>=1.21.0          # For numerical operations
# geopy>=2.2.0           # For advanced geocoding
# cryptography>=3.4.0    # For enhanced security features
# sqlalchemy>=1.4.0      # For database connectivity
# pytest>=6.0.0          # For testing framework

# The current implementation uses only Python standard library modules:
# - json, csv, xml.etree.ElementTree for data parsing
# - re for regular expressions
# - hashlib, hmac for cryptographic operations
# - datetime for time handling
# - pathlib for file operations
# - logging for application logging
# - typing for type hints
# - dataclasses for data structures
# - collections for specialized containers
# - difflib for string similarity
# - math for mathematical operations
